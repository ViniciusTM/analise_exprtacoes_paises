# Clustering Analysis on Countries Export Strategy

This work is the result of a project developed for a Machine Learning class taught at _Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais_. Data gathered from: https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/resources/data/

## Abstract
In the word some techniques from data analysis and unsupervised learning were applied to a countries exports dataset in order to find a handful of strategies that explain coutries behavior.
The export data are relative to product classes based on the first two digits of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding Systems. The techniques applied in this project are:

* Principal component analysis (PCA)
* t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)
* Hierarchical Clustering
* K-means
